# Introduction

Fluent is the first [blended execution network](https://mirror.xyz/fluentlabs.eth/8IelEprNblwr1HENCzbp9WFEc7FieEapD5SAiBNUBGA) - an Ethereum L2 and framework that blends Wasm, EVM and (soon) SVM-based smart contracts into a unified execution environment.

Smart contracts from different VM targets can directly call each other on Fluent. Fluent is in public devnet and currently supports apps composed of Solidity, Vyper, and Rust contracts.
